# Downloading the model
To use the colorization model, download the following files and add them to this
folder. 

* [Model architecture for Caffe](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/models/colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt)
* A [script](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/colorization/models/fetch_release_models.sh) for downloading the actual model parameters.  
This is quite big in size and can thus not be uploaded on github. 
* [More data needed by the model](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/colorization/resources/pts_in_hull.npy)
